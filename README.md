# Advanced Regression

Day 5 of Data Science Training Program

For this session, we used advanced regression techniques to predict the sale price of houses in New York City.

The following steps were taken:

1. Loading of Data
2. Data exploration using Panda profiling
3. Dropping unnecessary columns
4. Changing data types e.g from 'object' to 'numeric' , 'int64' to 'category', etc.
5. Delete duplicate rows
6. Imputing missing data using median
7. Data visualization using heatmap
